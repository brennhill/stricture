    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Ingest service topology and field annotations from source repos and APIs.</li>
      <li>Export lineage artifacts and compare against a baseline release snapshot.</li>
      <li>Classify drift by severity and enforce policy in warn or block mode.</li>
      <li>Attach ownership and escalation routes directly to affected fields.</li>
      <li>Evaluate architecture invariants such as dependency direction and provenance completeness.</li>
    </ol>

      The demo shows 14 connected systems across logistics, fintech, media,
      ecommerce, and governance with real-time mutation, rerun, and architecture invariant enforcement.

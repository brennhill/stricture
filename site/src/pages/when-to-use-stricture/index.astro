    <h1>When should you use Stricture with OpenTelemetry, OpenAPI, OpenLineage, or similar tools?</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Most teams should use multiple standards together. Stricture is intentionally built to overlay with adjacent tools,
      so you avoid redundant annotation work while adding deploy-time drift and lineage enforcement.
